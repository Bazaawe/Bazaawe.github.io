			<p class="paragraph-words">"If competition is healthy then domination is immunity" <br>Grant Cardone</p>
			<div class="container"><p class="paragraph-story">My name is Latif. I am a first year Information Technology(IT) student at Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology. I aspire to be a software developer at the end of my studying period. This is because I enjoy programming and developing websites. I believe we are at the center of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.<hr></p>
			<br> <p>In fact, to me IT is to the Fourth Industrial Revolution what blood is to the body. Although there has always been a great demand for IT people, the covid-19 pandemic has further amplified the demand. The demand has been amplified because businesses, organisations and institutions are trying to move digital so as to minimise contact and in turn minimise the spread of the virus. Information technology is very broad. It ranges from Artificial Intelligence(AI), machine learning,basic end user computing, Cyber-security, Networking, to Program and Software development.I am a student who is interested artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, program and software development.</p>
			<br>
			<p>With regards to the abovemetioned interest in the various sects of IT, I also like being part of groups. Either working or learning in groups. As a true fan of soccer I have over the years learnt the importance of being part of a team. I believe in the saying "If you want to go fast, move alone but if you want to go far move in a group." </p>
